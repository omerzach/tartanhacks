1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,166
The President:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President,

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,600
members of
Congress,

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,500
my fellow Americans:

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,900
Today in America, a
teacher spent extra time

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,934
with a student who needed
it,

6
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:24,033
and did her part to lift
America's graduation rate

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,333
to its highest level in more
than three decades.

8
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:32,433
An entrepreneur flipped
on the lights in her tech

9
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:37,166
startup, and did her part
to add to the more than

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,567
8 million new jobs our
businesses have created

11
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,033
over the past four years.

12
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:49,033
[Applause]

13
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,967
An autoworker
fine-tuned some

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,166
of the best, most fuel-efficient
cars in the world,

15
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,667
and did his part to help America
wean itself

16
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:58,667
off foreign oil.

17
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:03,300
A farmer prepared for the
spring after the strongest

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,100
five-year stretch of farm
exports in our history.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,734
A rural doctor gave a
young child

20
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,333
the first prescription to treat
asthma

21
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,333
that his mother could afford.

22
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:20,934
[Applause]

23
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,300
A man took
the bus home

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,100
from the graveyard shift,
bone-tired, but dreaming

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,834
big dreams for his son.

26
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,367
And in tight-knit
communities all across

27
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,433
America, fathers and
mothers will

28
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:39,000
tuck in their kids, put an arm
around their spouse,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,400
remember fallen comrades, and
give thanks for being home from

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,233
a war that, after 12 long
years,

31
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,433
is finally coming to an end.

32
00:01:47,433 --> 00:02:08,834
[Applause]

33
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,400
Tonight, this chamber
speaks with one voice

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,900
to the people we represent:
It is you, our citizens,

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,533
who make the state
of our union strong.

36
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:26,433
[Applause]

37
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,734
And here are the results
of your efforts:

38
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,934
The lowest unemployment
rate in over five years.

39
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,400
[Applause]

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,333
A rebounding
housing market.

41
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,266
[Applause] A manufacturing
sector that's adding

42
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:41,533
jobs for the first time
since the 1990s.

43
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:45,633
[Applause] More oil
produced at home

44
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,700
than we buy from the rest of the
world --

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,967
the first time that's happened
in nearly 20 years.

46
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:58,033
[Applause] Our deficits
-- cut by more than half.

47
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:03,400
[Applause] And for the
first time in over a

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,700
decade, business leaders
around the world have

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,867
declared that China is no
longer

50
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:13,867
the world's number one place to
invest; America is.

51
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,300
[Applause]

52
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:31,734
That's why I believe this
can be a breakthrough

53
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:32,734
year for America.

54
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:37,633
After five years of grit
and determined effort,

55
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,600
the United States is better
positioned

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,767
for the 21st century than any
other nation on Earth.

57
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,767
The question for everyone
in this chamber, running

58
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:52,200
through every decision we
make this year,

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,100
is whether we are going to help
or hinder this progress.

60
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,467
For several years now,
this town has been

61
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,667
consumed by a rancorous
argument over

62
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:06,100
the proper size of the
federal government.

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,266
It's an important debate
-- one that dates back

64
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:10,266
to our very founding.

65
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,800
But when that debate
prevents us from carrying

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,500
out even the most basic
functions of our democracy

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,033
-- when our differences
shut down government

68
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,166
or threaten the full faith
and credit of the United

69
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,333
States -- then we are
not doing right

70
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,567
by the American people.

71
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:41,533
[Applause]

72
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,266
Now, as President, I'm
committed to making

73
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,633
Washington work better,
and rebuilding

74
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,400
the trust of the people
who sent us here.

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,834
And I believe most
of you are, too.

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,100
Last month, thanks to
the work of Democrats

77
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
and Republicans, Congress
finally produced

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,100
a budget that undoes some of
last year's severe cuts

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,033
to priorities like education.

80
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,767
Nobody got everything they
wanted, and we can still

81
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:09,800
do more to invest in this
country's future

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,200
while bringing down our deficit
in a balanced way,

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,467
but the budget compromise should
leave us freer

84
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,867
to focus on creating new jobs,
not creating new crises.

85
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:25,000
[Applause]

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,867
In the coming months,
let's see where else

87
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:29,667
we can make progress
together.

88
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,667
Let's make this
a year of action.

89
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,433
That's what most Americans
want: for all

90
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:38,934
of us in this chamber to focus
on their lives,

91
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:43,400
their hopes, their aspirations.

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,934
What I believe unites the
people of this nation --

93
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:49,300
regardless of race or
region or party,

94
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,133
young or old, rich or poor --
is the simple, profound

95
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,600
belief in opportunity for
all -- the notion that if

96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,233
you work hard and take
responsibility,

97
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,233
you can get ahead in America.

98
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:10,300
[Applause]

99
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,834
Let's face it: That belief
has suffered

100
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:15,567
some serious blows.

101
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,433
Over more than three
decades, even before the

102
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:19,934
Great Recession hit,
massive shifts in

103
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,967
technology and global
competition

104
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:25,967
had eliminated a lot of good,
middle-class jobs,

105
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,700
and weakened the economic
foundations

106
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,467
that families depend on.

107
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:33,734
Today, after four years of
economic growth,

108
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:37,166
corporate profits and stock
prices have rarely been higher,

109
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,633
and those at the top
have never done better.

110
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,934
But average wages
have barely budged.

111
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,734
Inequality has deepened.

112
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:51,200
Upward mobility
has stalled.

113
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,266
The cold, hard fact is
that even

114
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:56,133
in the midst of recovery, too
many Americans are working more

115
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:59,767
than ever just to get by,
let alone to get ahead.

116
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,166
And too many still
aren't working at all.

117
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:10,100
So our job is to
reverse these trends.

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,433
It won't happen right
away,

119
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:12,800
and we won't agree on everything.

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,600
But what I offer tonight
is a set of concrete,

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,500
practical proposals
to speed up growth,

122
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,834
strengthen the middle
class,

123
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,867
and build new ladders of
opportunity

124
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,166
into the middle class.

125
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,767
Some require congressional
action,

126
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:31,967
and I am eager to work with all of you.

127
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,000
But America does not stand
still --

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,066
and neither will I.

129
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,700
[Applause] So wherever and
whenever I can take steps

130
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,100
without legislation to
expand opportunity

131
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,800
for more American families,
that's

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,800
what I'm going to do.

133
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:57,166
[Applause]

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,400
As usual, our First Lady
sets a good example.

135
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:24,200
[Applause]

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,734
Michelle's
Let's Move partnership

137
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:28,867
with schools, businesses,
local leaders has helped

138
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,767
bring down childhood
obesity rates

139
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,600
for the first time in 30 years.

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,166
[Applause] And that's
an achievement

141
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,066
that will improve lives and
reduce health

142
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:39,133
care costs for decades to come.

143
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,066
The Joining Forces
alliance that Michelle and

144
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,066
Jill Biden launched
has already encouraged

145
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,700
employers to hire or train

146
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,533
nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.

147
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:56,734
[Applause]

148
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,133
Taking a page from that
playbook,

149
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,834
the White House just organized a
College Opportunity Summit,

150
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:04,033
where already, 150 universities,
businesses,

151
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:07,767
nonprofits have made concrete
commitments to reduce

152
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:10,433
inequality in access to
higher education --

153
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:13,867
and to help every hardworking
kid go to college and succeed

154
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,567
when they get to campus.

155
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:16,367
[Applause]

156
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,567
And across the country,

157
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,367
we're partnering with mayors,
governors, and state

158
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:24,100
legislatures on issues from
homelessness

159
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,233
to marriage equality.

160
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,367
The point is there are
millions of Americans

161
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:32,166
outside of Washington
who are tired

162
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,600
of stale political arguments and
are moving

163
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,300
this country forward.

164
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,600
They believe, and I
believe,

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,333
that here in America, our
success should depend

166
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,400
not on accident of birth, but
the strength of our work ethic

167
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,066
and the scope
of our dreams.

168
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:53,834
That's what drew
our forebears here.

169
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,967
It's how the daughter of
a factory worker

170
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,066
is CEO of America's largest
automaker.

171
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:03,867
[Applause]

172
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,467
How the son of a barkeep

173
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:12,934
is Speaker of the House.

174
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:28,100
[Applause]

175
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,500
How the son of a single mom can

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,033
be President of the greatest nation on Earth.

177
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:47,300
[Applause]

178
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,700
Opportunity is who we are.

179
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,834
And the defining project
of our generation must

180
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,567
be to restore that promise.

181
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:02,066
We know where to start:
The best measure

182
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:06,433
of opportunity is
access to a good job.

183
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,700
With the economy picking
up speed,

184
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,400
companies say they intend to
hire more people this year.

185
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,166
And over half of big
manufacturers

186
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,100
say they're thinking of
insourcing jobs from abroad.

187
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,700
[Applause]

188
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,467
So let's make that
decision easier

189
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,200
for more companies.

190
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,867
Both Democrats and
Republicans have argued

191
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,367
that our tax code is
riddled with wasteful,

192
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:33,066
complicated loopholes
that punish businesses

193
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:35,600
investing here and reward
companies

194
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,333
that keep profits abroad.

195
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,266
Let's flip that equation.

196
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,467
Let's work together to
close those loopholes,

197
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,600
end those incentives to ship
jobs overseas,

198
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,834
and lower tax rates for
businesses

199
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,400
that create jobs right here at home.

200
00:11:47,934 --> 00:12:03,500
[Applause]

201
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,767
Moreover, we can take the
money we save from

202
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,500
this transition to tax reform
to create jobs rebuilding

203
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,233
our roads, upgrading our ports,

204
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,333
unclogging our commutes --
because in today's global

205
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,133
economy, first-class jobs
gravitate

206
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:21,000
to first-class infrastructure.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,533
We'll need Congress
to protect more than 3 million

208
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,467
jobs by finishing
transportation

209
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,433
and waterways bills
this summer.

210
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:29,834
[Applause]

211
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,333
That can happen.

212
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,033
But I'll act on my own
to slash bureaucracy

213
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,533
and streamline the permitting
process for key projects,

214
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,767
so we can get more
construction workers

215
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,300
on the job as fast
as possible.

216
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:50,433
[Applause]

217
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:53,266
We also have the chance,
right now, to beat other

218
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,433
countries in the race for
the next wave

219
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,166
of high-tech manufacturing jobs.

220
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,734
My administration has
launched two hubs

221
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:02,033
for high-tech manufacturing

222
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,667
in Raleigh, North Carolina and Youngstown, Ohio,

223
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,467
where we've connected businesses
to research universities that

224
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:12,200
can help America lead the world
in advanced technologies.

225
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,600
Tonight, I'm announcing
we'll launch

226
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,867
six more this year.

227
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:19,533
Bipartisan bills in both
houses could double

228
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,934
the number of these hubs and
the jobs they create.

229
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,934
So get those bills to my
desk;

230
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:29,633
put more Americans back to work.

231
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:33,233
[Applause]

232
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:39,233
Let's do more to help the
entrepreneurs and small

233
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,066
business owners who create
most new jobs in America.

234
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,367
Over the past five years,
my administration has made

235
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,533
more loans to small
business owners

236
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,100
than any other.

237
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,033
And when 98 percent of
our exporters

238
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,967
are small businesses, new trade
partnerships

239
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,967
with Europe and the Asia Pacific will

240
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,633
help them create more jobs.

241
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:06,133
We need to work together
on tools like bipartisan

242
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,633
Trade Promotion Authority
to protect our workers,

243
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,200
protect our environment,
and open new markets

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,900
to new goods stamped
"Made in the USA."

245
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:29,200
[Applause]

246
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,934
Listen, China and Europe
aren't standing

247
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:36,400
on the sidelines, and
neither should we.

248
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,233
We know that the nation
that goes

249
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,934
all-in on innovation today will

250
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:43,400
own the global economy tomorrow.

251
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,133
This is an edge America
cannot surrender.

252
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,200
Federally funded research
helped

253
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,800
lead to the ideas and inventions
behind Google and smartphones.

254
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,266
And that's why Congress
should undo the damage

255
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,967
done by last year's cuts
to basic research

256
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,600
so we can unleash the next

257
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,600
great American discovery.

258
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,934
[Applause]

259
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:17,567
There are entire
industries to be built

260
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,567
based on vaccines
that stay ahead

261
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,667
of drug-resistant bacteria,
or paper-thin material

262
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,867
that's stronger
than steel.

263
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:28,133
And let's pass a patent
reform bill that allows

264
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,400
our businesses to stay
focused on innovation,

265
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,533
not costly and needless
litigation.

266
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:40,734
[Applause]

267
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,333
Now, one of the biggest
factors

268
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,166
in bringing more jobs back is
our commitment

269
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,433
to American energy.

270
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,467
The all-of-the-above
energy strategy

271
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:53,233
I announced a few years ago
is working, and today,

272
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,834
America is closer to
energy independence

273
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,567
than we have been in decades.

274
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:04,100
[Applause]

275
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,233
One of the reasons why
is natural gas

276
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:10,166
-- if extracted safely, it's the
bridge fuel that

277
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,800
can power our economy with less
of the carbon pollution that

278
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,467
causes climate change.

279
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:19,166
Businesses plan to invest
almost $100 billion

280
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,934
in new factories that
use natural gas.

281
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,233
I'll cut red tape to help
states get those factories

282
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,233
built and put folks to
work,

283
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,033
and this Congress can help by
putting people

284
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,033
to work building fueling

285
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,066
stations that shift more
cars and trucks

286
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,567
from foreign oil to
American natural gas.

287
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:41,333
[Applause]

288
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,533
Meanwhile, my
administration will

289
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,300
keep working with the industry
to sustain production

290
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,633
and jobs growth while
strengthening protection

291
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,900
of our air, our water,
our communities.

292
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
And while we're at it,
I'll use my authority

293
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,066
to protect more of our
pristine federal lands

294
00:16:55,066 --> 00:17:00,266
for future generations.

295
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:10,967
[Applause]

296
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,900
It's not just oil and
natural gas production

297
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,233
that's booming; we're
becoming

298
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:18,333
a global leader in solar, too.

299
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,533
Every four minutes,
another American home

300
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:24,066
or business goes solar, every
panel pounded

301
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:28,934
into place by a worker whose job
cannot be outsourced.

302
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,800
Let's continue that
progress with a smarter

303
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,133
tax policy that stops
giving $4 billion a year

304
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,533
to fossil fuel industries
that don't need it,

305
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:43,333
so we can invest more in fuels
of the future that do.

306
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:52,700
[Applause]

307
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,333
And even as we've
increased energy

308
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,033
production, we've
partnered with businesses,

309
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,467
builders, and local
communities

310
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:03,166
to reduce the energy we consume.

311
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,633
When we rescued our
automakers, for example,

312
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,066
we worked with them to
set

313
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,433
higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.

314
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:12,400
In the coming months, I'll
build on that success

315
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,967
by setting new standards for
our trucks,

316
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,767
so we can keep driving down oil
imports

317
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,834
and what we pay at the pump.

318
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,567
And taken together, our
energy policy is creating

319
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:28,133
jobs and leading to a
cleaner, safer planet.

320
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,433
Over the past eight years,
the United States

321
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,967
has reduced our total carbon
pollution more than any

322
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,967
other nation on Earth.

323
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:43,000
[Applause]

324
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,800
But we have to
act with more urgency --

325
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,100
because a changing climate
is already

326
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,400
harming Western communities
struggling with drought,

327
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,266
and coastal cities dealing
with floods.

328
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,734
That's why I directed my
administration

329
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,033
to work with states, utilities,
and others to set new

330
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,967
standards on the amount of
carbon pollution

331
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,433
our power plants are allowed
to dump into the air.

332
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,033
[Applause]

333
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:08,133
The shift to a cleaner
energy economy won't

334
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:10,967
happen overnight, and it
will require

335
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,567
some tough choices along the way.

336
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,633
But the debate is settled.

337
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,500
Climate change is a fact.

338
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,100
[Applause] And when our
children's children

339
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,233
look us in the eye and ask if
we did all we could

340
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:25,000
to leave them a safer, more
stable world,

341
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,633
with new sources of energy, I want

342
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,600
us to be able to say yes, we did.

343
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:44,467
[Applause]

344
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,567
Finally, if we're serious
about economic growth,

345
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,967
it is time to heed the call
of business leaders,

346
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:53,900
labor leaders, faith leaders,
law enforcement --

347
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,867
and fix our broken
immigration system.

348
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,266
[Applause] Republicans and
Democrats

349
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,066
in the Senate have acted.

350
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,600
And I know that members of
both parties

351
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,867
in the House want to do the same.

352
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:22,000
Independent economists say
immigration reform

353
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,100
will grow our economy and
shrink our deficits by

354
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,200
almost $1 trillion in
the next two decades.

355
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,700
And for good reason:
When people come here

356
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,900
to fulfill their dreams -- to
study, invent,

357
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,033
contribute to our culture --
they make our country

358
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,633
a more attractive place for
businesses to locate and

359
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,033
create jobs for everybody.

360
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,633
So let's get immigration
reform done this year.

361
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:47,400
[Applause]

362
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,467
Let's
get it done.

363
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:50,300
It's time.

364
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,033
[Applause]

365
00:20:57,266 --> 00:21:00,433
The ideas I've outlined
so far can speed up growth

366
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,734
and create more jobs.

367
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:05,667
But in this rapidly
changing economy,

368
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,533
we have to make sure that every
American has the skills

369
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,000
to fill those jobs.

370
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,300
The good news is we
know how to do it.

371
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,667
Two years ago, as the
auto industry came roaring

372
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,166
back, Andra Rush opened

373
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,367
up a manufacturing firm in Detroit.

374
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,400
She knew that Ford needed
parts for the best-selling

375
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,867
truck in America, and she
knew how

376
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,133
to make those parts.

377
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,834
She just needed
the workforce.

378
00:21:30,834 --> 00:21:32,700
So she dialed up what
we call

379
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,867
an American Jobs Center, places
where folks can walk

380
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,533
in to get the help or training
they need to find

381
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,500
a new job or a better job.

382
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,433
She was flooded
with new workers.

383
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:46,166
And today, Detroit
Manufacturing Systems

384
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,300
has more than 700 employees.

385
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,367
And what Andra and her
employees experienced

386
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:56,066
is how it should be for every
employer

387
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,233
and every job seeker.

388
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,166
So tonight, I've asked
Vice President Biden

389
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,200
to lead an across-the-board
reform of America's

390
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,467
training programs to
make sure

391
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:10,033
they have one mission: Train
Americans with the skills

392
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:13,767
employers need, and match them
to good jobs that need

393
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,100
to be filled right now.

394
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:31,400
[Applause]

395
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,333
That means more on-the-job
training and more

396
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,100
apprenticeships that set a
young worker

397
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,000
on an upward trajectory for life.

398
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,266
It means connecting
companies

399
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:42,333
to community colleges that can
help design training

400
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,834
to fill their specific needs.

401
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:47,000
And if Congress wants to
help,

402
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,467
you can concentrate funding on
proven programs that connect

403
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,567
more ready-to-work Americans

404
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,300
with ready-to-be-filled jobs.

405
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm also convinced we can
help Americans return

406
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,633
to the workforce faster by
reforming unemployment

407
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,834
insurance so that it's
more effective

408
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,800
in today's economy.

409
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,934
But first, this Congress
needs to restore

410
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,467
the unemployment insurance you
just let expire

411
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:26,066
for 1.6 million people.

412
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:30,934
[Applause]

413
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,033
Let me tell you why.

414
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:37,533
Misty DeMars is a mother
of two young boys.

415
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,533
She'd been steadily
employed since

416
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,667
she was a teenager, put herself
through college.

417
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,767
She'd never collected
unemployment benefits,

418
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:47,667
but she'd been paying taxes.

419
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,767
In May, she and her
husband

420
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:52,934
used their life savings to buy
their first home.

421
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:57,900
A week later, budget cuts
claimed the job she loved.

422
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,600
Last month, when their
unemployment

423
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,767
insurance was cut off, she sat
down and wrote me a letter,

424
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,767
the kind I get every day.

425
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,867
"We are the face of the

426
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,100
unemployment crisis," she wrote.

427
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
"I'm not dependent
on the government.

428
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,734
Our country depends on
people like

429
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:19,900
us who build careers, contribute
to society,

430
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,333
care about our neighbors.

431
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,500
I'm confident that in time
I will find a job,

432
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,934
I will pay my taxes, and we will
raise our children

433
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,000
in their own home in the
community we love.

434
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,166
Please give us
this chance."

435
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:39,066
Congress, give these
hardworking, responsible

436
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:42,300
Americans that chance.

437
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
[Applause]

438
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,166
Give them that chance.

439
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,767
[Applause]

440
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:49,967
Give them the chance.

441
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:56,200
[Applause]

442
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,367
They need our
help right now.

443
00:24:57,367 --> 00:24:59,233
But more important, this
country needs

444
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,800
them in the game.

445
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,367
That's why I've been
asking CEOs

446
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,867
to give more long-term
unemployed workers

447
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:09,133
a fair shot at new jobs, a new
chance

448
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,367
to support their families.

449
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,333
And in fact, this week,
many will come

450
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,433
to the White House to make
that commitment real.

451
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,500
Tonight, I ask every
business leader in America

452
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,800
to join us and to do the
same --

453
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,333
because we are stronger when
America fields a full team.

454
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:30,467
[Applause]

455
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,166
Of course, it's not
enough

456
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:35,734
to train today's workforce.

457
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,533
We also have to prepare
tomorrow's workforce,

458
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,900
by guaranteeing every child
access

459
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,133
to a world-class education.

460
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:50,033
[Applause]

461
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:53,600
Estiven Rodriguez couldn't
speak a word of English

462
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,467
when he moved to New
York City at age nine.

463
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,500
But last month, thanks
to the support

464
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,633
of great teachers and an
innovative tutoring program,

465
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:07,166
he led a march of his classmates
through a crowd

466
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,367
of cheering parents and
neighbors

467
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,166
from their high school to the
post office,

468
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,800
where they mailed off their
college applications.

469
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,100
And this son of a factory
worker just found

470
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:22,834
out he's going to college
this fall.

471
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:28,800
[Applause]

472
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Five years ago, we set out
to change

473
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,333
the odds for all our kids.

474
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,500
We worked with lenders to
reform student loans,

475
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,734
and today, more young people
are earning college

476
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:40,667
degrees than ever before.

477
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,600
Race to the Top, with the
help of governors

478
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,900
from both parties, has helped
states

479
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,000
raise expectations and performance.

480
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,367
Teachers and principals in
schools from Tennessee

481
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:53,667
to Washington, D.C. are
making big strides

482
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,066
in preparing students with
the skills

483
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,100
for the new economy

484
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,700
-- problem solving, critical thinking,

485
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,834
science, technology, engineering, math.

486
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:09,000
Some of this
change is hard.

487
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,200
It requires everything
from more challenging

488
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
curriculums and more
demanding parents

489
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,033
to better support for
teachers and new ways

490
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,200
to measure how well our kids
think,

491
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,934
not how well they can fill in a
bubble on a test.

492
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:27,500
But it is worth it
and it is working.

493
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,300
The problem is we're still
not reaching enough kids,

494
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,400
and we're not
reaching them in time.

495
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,700
And that has to change.

496
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:38,500
Research shows that one
of the best investments

497
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,834
we can make in a child's
life

498
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,834
is high-quality early education.

499
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:50,667
[Applause]

500
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:56,667
Last year, I
asked this

501
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,233
Congress to help states make
high-quality

502
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:05,600
pre-K available to
every 4-year-old.

503
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,900
And as a parent as well as
a President,

504
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,800
I repeat that request tonight.

505
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,567
But in the meantime, 30
states have raised

506
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,934
pre-k funding on their own.

507
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,166
They know we can't wait.

508
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,200
So just as we worked
with states to reform

509
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,767
our schools, this year we'll
invest

510
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,200
in new partnerships with states
and communities across

511
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,767
the country in a Race to
the

512
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,367
Top for our youngest children.

513
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,700
And as Congress decides
what it's going

514
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,734
to do, I'm going to pull
together a coalition

515
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:33,800
of elected officials, business
leaders,

516
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,400
and philanthropists willing to
help more kids

517
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,333
access the high-quality pre-K
that they need.

518
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,333
[Applause]

519
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,867
It is right for America. We need to get this done.

520
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:47,867
[Applause]

521
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:57,233
Last year, I also pledged
to connect 99 percent

522
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:59,467
of our students to high-speed
broadband

523
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,967
over the next four years.

524
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:03,133
Tonight, I can announce
that

525
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:07,533
with the support of the FCC and
companies like Apple, Microsoft,

526
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:10,934
Sprint, and Verizon, we've got
a down payment

527
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:14,066
to start connecting more than
15,000 schools

528
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:16,767
and 20 million students over the
next two years,

529
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,367
without adding a dime
to the deficit.

530
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:20,300
[Applause]

531
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:28,200
We're working to redesign
high schools and partner

532
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,266
them with colleges and
employers that offer

533
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,800
the real-world education and
hands-on training

534
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,333
that can lead directly to
a job and career.

535
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,567
We're shaking up our
system of higher education

536
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:41,800
to give parents more
information and colleges

537
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,667
more incentives to offer
better value,

538
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,100
so that no middle-class kid is
priced

539
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,367
out of a college education.

540
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,900
We're offering millions
the opportunity

541
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,400
to cap their monthly student
loan payments to 10 percent

542
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,000
of their income, and I want
to work with Congress

543
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,834
to see how we can help even
more Americans

544
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,734
who feel trapped by
student loan debt.

545
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:09,367
[Applause]

546
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:11,066
And I'm reaching out to some of
America's

547
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,934
leading foundations and corporations

548
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,300
on a new
initiative to help more

549
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,767
young men of color facing
especially tough odds

550
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,734
to stay on track and reach
their full potential.

551
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,900
The bottom line is
Michelle and I want

552
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,033
every child to have the same
chance

553
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,033
this country gave us.

554
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:32,600
But we know our
opportunity agenda won't

555
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,533
be complete -- and too
many young people

556
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,233
entering the workforce today
will see the American Dream

557
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,867
as an empty promise -- unless
we also do more

558
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:47,200
to make sure our economy honors
the dignity of work,

559
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,133
and hard work pays off for
every single American.

560
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:56,734
Today, women make up about
half our workforce,

561
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:59,500
but they still make 77 cents
for every dollar

562
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,867
a man earns.

563
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:04,900
That is wrong, and
in 2014,

564
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,367
it's an embarrassment.

565
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:12,066
Women deserve equal
pay for equal work.

566
00:31:12,066 --> 00:31:31,066
[Applause]

567
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:35,433
She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.

568
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,433
A mother deserves a day
off to care for

569
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,867
a sick child or a sick parent
without

570
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,033
running into hardship.

571
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:46,100
[Applause] And you know
what, a father does, too.

572
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,834
It is time to do away with
workplace policies

573
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:50,500
that belong in a "Mad
Men" episode.

574
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,400
[Laughter]

575
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,900
[Applause]

576
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,867
This year, let's all come together -- Congress,

577
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:57,367
the White House, businesses from
Wall Street to Main Street --

578
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,900
to give every woman the
opportunity she deserves.

579
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,433
[Applause]

580
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:03,266
Because
I believe when women

581
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:05,066
succeed, America succeeds.

582
00:32:05,066 --> 00:32:23,233
[Applause]

583
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:29,500
Now, women hold a majority
of lower-wage jobs,

584
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,734
but they're not the only ones
stifled by stagnant wages.

585
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,633
Americans understand that
some people

586
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:38,567
will earn more money than
others, and we don't resent

587
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:39,900
those who, by virtue of their

588
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,300
efforts, achieve incredible success.

589
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,967
That's what America
is all about.

590
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:49,033
But Americans
overwhelmingly agree that

591
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,533
no one who works full-time
should ever have

592
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,200
to raise a family in poverty.

593
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,200
[Applause]

594
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,567
In the year since I asked
this Congress to raise the

595
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:16,066
minimum wage, five states
have passed

596
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:18,667
laws to raise theirs.

597
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,567
Many businesses have
done it on their own.

598
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:24,600
Nick Chute is here today

599
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,967
with his boss, John Soranno.

600
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,934
John's an owner of Punch
Pizza in Minneapolis,

601
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,934
and Nick helps make the dough.

602
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,667
[Laughter] Only now
he makes more of it.

603
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,800
[Laughter] John just gave
his employees a raise,

604
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
to 10 bucks an hour -- and
that's a decision

605
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,633
that has eased their financial

606
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,100
stress and boosted their morale.

607
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,734
Tonight, I ask more of
America's business leaders

608
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:53,900
to follow John's lead: Do
what you can to raise

609
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,066
your employees' wages.

610
00:33:55,066 --> 00:34:01,033
[Applause]

611
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,033
It's good
for the economy.

612
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:02,900
It's good for America.

613
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:09,300
[Applause]

614
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,000
To every mayor,
governor, state legislator

615
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,834
in America, I say you
don't have to wait

616
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,800
for Congress to act --
Americans will support

617
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,967
you if you take this on.

618
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,633
And as a chief executive,
I intend

619
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:24,600
to lead by example.

620
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,767
Profitable corporations
like Costco see higher

621
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:31,400
wages as the smart way
to boost productivity

622
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,567
and reduce turnover.

623
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:35,567
We should too.

624
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:37,533
In the coming weeks, I
will issue an executive

625
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,900
order requiring federal
contractors

626
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,000
to pay their federally funded
employees a fair wage

627
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,467
of at least $10.10 an hour --
because if you cook our troops'

628
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:50,967
meals or wash their
dishes,

629
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:56,967
you should not have to live in poverty.

630
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,767
[Applause]

631
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,834
Of course, to reach
millions more, Congress

632
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,800
does need to get on board.

633
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,166
Today, the federal minimum
wage is worth about

634
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,700
20 percent less than it was
when

635
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,667
Ronald Reagan first stood here.

636
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,033
And Tom Harkin and George
Miller have a bill

637
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:24,266
to fix that by lifting the
minimum wage to $10.10.

638
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:27,500
It's easy to
remember, $10.10.

639
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,900
This will help families.

640
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,467
It will give businesses
customers with

641
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,500
more money to spend.

642
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,600
It does not involve any
new bureaucratic program.

643
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,467
So join the rest
of the country.

644
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:40,433
Say yes.

645
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:41,700
Give America a raise.

646
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,400
[Applause]

647
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,166
Give them a raise.

648
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:59,834
[Applause]

649
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,800
There are other steps we
can take to help families

650
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,700
make ends meet, and few
are more effective

651
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,367
at reducing inequality and
helping families pull

652
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,767
themselves up through
hard work than

653
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,066
the Earned Income Tax Credit.

654
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,700
Right now, it helps about
half

655
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,233
of all parents at some point.

656
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,800
Think about that -- it
helps about half

657
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,900
of all parents in America at
some point in their lives.

658
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,033
But I agree with
Republicans like

659
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:26,667
Senator Rubio that it doesn't do
enough for single workers

660
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,500
who don't have kids.

661
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,934
So let's work together
to strengthen the credit,

662
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:33,500
reward work, help more
Americans get ahead.

663
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,100
Let's do more to help
Americans

664
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,800
save for retirement.

665
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,400
Today, most workers
don't have a pension.

666
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,300
A Social Security check
often isn't

667
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,367
enough on its own.

668
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,200
And while the stock market
has doubled

669
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,533
over the last five years, that
doesn't help folks

670
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:52,734
who don't have 401(k)s.

671
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:56,433
That's why, tomorrow, I
will direct

672
00:36:56,433 --> 00:37:00,400
the Treasury to create a new way
for working Americans

673
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,900
to start their own retirement
savings: MyRA.

674
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,400
It's a new savings bond
that encourages

675
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,166
folks to build a nest egg.

676
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:16,467
MyRA guarantees a decent
return with no risk of

677
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,600
losing what you put in.

678
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,633
And if this Congress wants
to help, work with

679
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:24,333
me to fix an upside-down tax
code that gives

680
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:27,400
big tax breaks to help the
wealthy save,

681
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,300
but does little or nothing for
middle-class Americans.

682
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,800
Offer every American
access to an automatic

683
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,367
IRA on the job, so they can
save at work

684
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,967
just like everyone in this
chamber can.

685
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,066
And since the most
important investment

686
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:45,000
many families make is their
home, send me legislation

687
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,367
that protects taxpayers
from footing

688
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,467
the bill for a housing crisis
ever again,

689
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,433
and keeps the dream of
homeownership

690
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:53,967
alive for future generations.

691
00:37:53,967 --> 00:38:07,400
[Applause]

692
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
One last point on
financial security:

693
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,066
For decades, few things
exposed hardworking

694
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,800
families to economic
hardship more

695
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,033
than a broken health care system.

696
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,233
And in case you haven't
heard,

697
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,567
we're in the process of fixing that.

698
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:30,500
[Applause]

699
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,133
A preexisting condition used

700
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,367
to mean that someone like Amanda
Shelley,

701
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:39,100
a physician's assistant and
single mom from Arizona,

702
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,333
couldn't get health insurance.

703
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:45,500
But on January 1st,
she got covered.

704
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,000
[Applause]

705
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,700
On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.

706
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,967
On January 6th, she
had emergency surgery.

707
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,800
Just one week earlier,
Amanda said,

708
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,166
that surgery would have meant
bankruptcy.

709
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,767
That's what health
insurance reform

710
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:10,133
is all about -- the peace of
mind that if misfortune

711
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:12,800
strikes, you don't have
to lose everything.

712
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:17,100
Already, because of the
Affordable Care Act,

713
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,333
more than 3 million Americans
under age 26 have gained

714
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:27,600
coverage under their
parents' plans.

715
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
[Applause]

716
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,934
More than 9
million Americans

717
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,767
have signed up for private
health insurance

718
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:32,800
or Medicaid coverage.

719
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,800
[Applause]

720
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Nine million.

721
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,934
And here's another
number: zero.

722
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:44,100
Because of this law, no
American -- none --

723
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,400
zero -- can ever again be
dropped or denied coverage

724
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,000
for a preexisting
condition like asthma,

725
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,033
or back pain, or cancer.

726
00:39:54,033 --> 00:40:05,166
[Applause]

727
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,500
No woman can
ever be charged more

728
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
just because she's a woman.

729
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:19,400
[Applause]

730
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,200
And we did all
this while adding years

731
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,033
to Medicare's finances,
keeping Medicare premiums

732
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:29,533
flat, and lowering
prescription costs

733
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:30,600
for millions of seniors.

734
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:35,100
Now, I do not expect to
convince

735
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,233
my Republican friends on the
merits of this law.

736
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,967
[Laughter]

737
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:44,233
But I know
that the American people

738
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,200
are not interested in
refighting old battles.

739
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,934
So, again, if you have
specific plans

740
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:55,300
to cut costs, cover more people,
increase choice --

741
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,900
tell America what you'd
do differently.

742
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,533
Let's see if the
numbers add up.

743
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:04,767
But let's not have another
40-something votes

744
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:06,633
to repeal a law that's
already helping

745
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:12,600
millions of Americans like Amanda.

746
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:40,300
[Applause]

747
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,300
The first 40 were plenty.

748
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,166
We all owe it to the
American people

749
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:49,066
to say what we're for, not
just what we're against.

750
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:52,200
And if you want to know
the real impact this law

751
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,433
is having, just talk to
Governor Steve Beshear

752
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:56,533
of Kentucky, who's
here tonight.

753
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:58,033
Now Kentucky is not the
most liberal

754
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,834
part of the country.

755
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:00,200
[Laughter]

756
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,900
That's not
where

757
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,900
I got my highest vote totals.

758
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,367
[Laughter]

759
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:06,000
But he's like
a man possessed

760
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,834
when it comes to covering his
commonwealth's families.

761
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:14,233
They are our neighbors
and our friends, he said.

762
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:17,533
"They're people we shop
and go to church with,

763
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:22,200
farmers out on the
tractor, grocery clerks.

764
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
They're people who go to
work every morning

765
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,166
praying they don't get sick.

766
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,500
No one deserves
to live that way."

767
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:32,967
Steve is right.

768
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,834
That's why, tonight, I ask
every American

769
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:38,166
who knows someone without health
insurance to help them get

770
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,500
covered by March 31st.

771
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,734
[Applause]

772
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:45,633
Help them get covered.

773
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:46,934
[Applause]

774
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:50,200
Moms, get on
your kids to sign up.

775
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,467
Kids, call your mom and
walk

776
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,467
her through the application.

777
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:55,367
It will give her some
peace of mind --

778
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:56,500
plus, she'll appreciate
hearing from you.

779
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:07,166
[Laughter]

780
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,166
After all, that's the
spirit that has always

781
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,700
moved this nation forward.

782
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,734
It's the spirit of
citizenship --

783
00:43:13,734 --> 00:43:16,100
the recognition that
through hard work

784
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,533
and responsibility, we can
pursue our individual

785
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:20,834
dreams but still come
together

786
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,800
as one American family to make
sure the next generation

787
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,266
can pursue its dreams as well.

788
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:30,433
Citizenship means standing
up for everyone's

789
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,433
right to vote.

790
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:49,700
[Applause]

791
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,667
Last year, part
of the Voting Rights Act

792
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:54,433
was weakened, but
conservative Republicans

793
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:56,533
and liberal Democrats
are working together

794
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,734
to strengthen it.

795
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:00,133
And the bipartisan
commission I appointed,

796
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:04,200
chaired by my campaign
lawyer and Governor

797
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,300
Romney's campaign lawyer,
came together and have

798
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,233
offered reforms so that no
one has to wait

799
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,033
more than a half hour to vote.

800
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:13,300
Let's support
these efforts.

801
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,066
[Applause]

802
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:15,867
It should be
the power of our vote,

803
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:17,734
not the size of our bank
accounts

804
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:19,266
that drives our democracy.

805
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:30,200
[Applause]

806
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,700
Citizenship means standing
up for the lives

807
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,500
that gun violence steals
from us each day.

808
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,100
I've seen the courage
of parents, students,

809
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,133
pastors, police officers
all over this country

810
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,567
who say "we are not afraid."

811
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:50,100
And I intend to keep
trying,

812
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,734
with or without Congress, to
help stop more tragedies

813
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:56,233
from visiting innocent
Americans

814
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:58,367
in our movie theaters, in our
shopping malls,

815
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,800
or schools like Sandy Hook.

816
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:14,533
[Applause]

817
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:18,967
Citizenship demands a
sense of common purpose;

818
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,633
participation in the hard
work of self-government;

819
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:26,767
an obligation to
serve our communities.

820
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:31,100
And I know this chamber
agrees that few Americans

821
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,100
give more to their country
than our diplomats

822
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:46,066
and the men and women of the

823
00:45:46,066 --> 00:46:07,533
United States Armed Forces.

824
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:13,266
[Applause]

825
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:16,567
Tonight, because of the
extraordinary troops

826
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:19,166
and civilians who risk and lay
down their lives

827
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:24,000
to keep us free, the United
States is more secure.

828
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,934
When I took office, nearly
180,000 Americans

829
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:30,500
were serving in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

830
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,133
Today, all our troops
are out of Iraq.

831
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:36,734
More than 60,000 of our
troops have already come

832
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:39,533
home from Afghanistan.

833
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:41,500
With Afghan forces now
in the lead for their

834
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,867
own security, our troops have
moved to a support role.

835
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:47,734
Together with our allies,
we will complete

836
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:50,467
our mission there by the
end of this year,

837
00:46:50,467 --> 00:46:53,100
and America's longest war
will finally be over.

838
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:07,834
[Applause]

839
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:11,433
After 2014, we will
support a unified

840
00:47:11,433 --> 00:47:13,800
Afghanistan as it takes
responsibility

841
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,500
for its own future.

842
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,033
If the Afghan government
signs a security agreement

843
00:47:19,033 --> 00:47:22,467
that we have negotiated,
a small force of Americans

844
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,767
could remain in
Afghanistan with NATO

845
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:29,033
allies to carry out two
narrow missions: training

846
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:31,367
and assisting
Afghan forces,

847
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:33,400
and counterterrorism
operations

848
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,367
to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.

849
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:39,567
For while our relationship
with Afghanistan

850
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:44,333
will change, one thing will
not: our resolve

851
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,300
that terrorists do not launch
attacks

852
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,300
against our country.

853
00:47:47,300 --> 00:48:05,667
[Applause]

854
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:10,633
The fact is that
danger remains.

855
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:12,567
While we put al Qaeda's
core leadership

856
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:16,133
on a path to defeat, the threat
has evolved as al Qaeda

857
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,467
affiliates and other
extremists take root

858
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:21,567
in different parts
of the world.

859
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:26,633
In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq,
Mali, we have

860
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,066
to keep working with partners to
disrupt

861
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:32,033
and disable those networks.

862
00:48:32,033 --> 00:48:34,266
In Syria, we'll support
the opposition that

863
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:38,900
rejects the agenda of
terrorist networks.

864
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,200
Here at home, we'll
keep strengthening

865
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,100
our defenses, and combat new
threats like cyberattacks.

866
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,800
And as we reform our
defense budget,

867
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,233
we will have to keep faith with
our men and women

868
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:53,033
in uniform, and invest in the
capabilities

869
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,433
they need to succeed in
future missions.

870
00:48:55,433 --> 00:49:14,667
[Applause]

871
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:18,266
We have to
remain vigilant.

872
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,066
But I strongly believe
our leadership

873
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:23,033
and our security cannot depend

874
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:26,867
on our outstanding military alone.

875
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,967
As Commander-in-Chief,
I have used force when

876
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,600
needed to protect the
American people,

877
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,934
and I will never hesitate to do
so as long

878
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:36,266
as I hold this office.

879
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,767
But I will not send our
troops into harm's way

880
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,000
unless it is truly
necessary,

881
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,700
nor will I allow our sons and
daughters to be mired

882
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,266
in open-ended conflicts.

883
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:49,767
We must fight the battles
that need to be fought,

884
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:52,367
not those that terrorists
prefer from us --

885
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:55,066
large-scale deployments
that drain our strength

886
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:57,066
and may ultimately
feed extremism.

887
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,700
So even as we actively
and aggressively pursue

888
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,834
terrorist networks --
through more targeted

889
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:08,100
efforts and by building
the capacity

890
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,467
of our foreign partners --
America must move

891
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,467
off a permanent war footing.

892
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:20,900
[Applause]

893
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,000
That's why I've
imposed prudent limits

894
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,934
on the use of drones -- for
we will not be safer

895
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:28,633
if people abroad believe
we strike within their

896
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:31,200
countries without regard
for the consequence.

897
00:50:31,867 --> 00:50:33,333
That's why, working with
this Congress,

898
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,000
I will reform our surveillance
programs,

899
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,533
because the vital work of our
intelligence community

900
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:40,433
depends on public
confidence,

901
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:44,700
here and abroad, that privacy of
ordinary people

902
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,700
is not being violated.

903
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,066
[Applause]

904
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:57,000
And with the Afghan war
ending, this needs

905
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,233
to be the year Congress lifts
the remaining restrictions

906
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:03,433
on detainee transfers and
we close the prison

907
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:05,533
at Guantanamo Bay --

908
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:06,533
[applause]

909
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,433
because we counter terrorism not
just through intelligence

910
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,133
and military actions, but
by remaining true

911
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:15,367
to our constitutional ideals,
and setting an example

912
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,233
for the rest of the world.

913
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:19,533
[Applause]

914
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,500
You see, in a world of
complex threats,

915
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,533
our security, our leadership
depends

916
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:31,533
on all elements of our power,
including

917
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:33,533
strong and principled diplomacy.

918
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,233
American diplomacy has
rallied more

919
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:40,066
than 50 countries to prevent
nuclear materials from

920
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:42,367
falling into the wrong
hands, and allowed

921
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:47,066
us to reduce our own reliance
on Cold War stockpiles.

922
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:50,033
American diplomacy, backed
by the threat of force,

923
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:52,033
is why Syria's chemical
weapons

924
00:51:52,033 --> 00:51:53,133
are being eliminated.

925
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:59,133
[Applause]

926
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,367
And we will continue
to work with

927
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,400
the international community
to usher in the future

928
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,934
the Syrian people deserve
-- a future free

929
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:09,633
of dictatorship,
terror and fear.

930
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:11,800
As we speak, American
diplomacy

931
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,266
is supporting the Israelis and
Palestinians as they

932
00:52:15,266 --> 00:52:18,166
engage in the difficult
but necessary talks

933
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:21,767
to end the conflict there; to
achieve dignity

934
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,934
and an independent state for
Palestinians,

935
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:27,400
and lasting peace and security
for the State of Israel --

936
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,600
a Jewish state that knows
America will

937
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,000
always be at their side.

938
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,600
[Applause]

939
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,967
And it is American
diplomacy,

940
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:54,400
backed by pressure, that has
halted the progress of Iran's

941
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,233
nuclear program and rolled
back parts of that program

942
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:03,000
for the very first
time in a decade.

943
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,300
As we gather here
tonight,

944
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,567
Iran has begun to eliminate its
stockpile of higher

945
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,700
levels of enriched uranium.

946
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,467
It's not installing
advanced centrifuges.

947
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:18,767
Unprecedented inspections
help the world verify

948
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:23,800
every day that Iran is
not building a bomb.

949
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,133
And with our allies and
partners, we're engaged

950
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:30,000
in negotiations to see if we
can peacefully achieve

951
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,767
a goal we all share:
preventing

952
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,867
Iran from obtaining a
nuclear weapon.

953
00:53:34,867 --> 00:53:49,900
[Applause]

954
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,734
These negotiations
will be difficult.

955
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:56,600
They may not succeed.

956
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,633
We are clear-eyed about
Iran's support

957
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,967
for terrorist organizations
like Hezbollah,

958
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,700
which threatens our allies.

959
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,967
And we're clear about
the mistrust between

960
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:10,834
our nations, mistrust that
cannot be wished away.

961
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:15,266
But these negotiations
don't rely on trust.

962
00:54:15,266 --> 00:54:17,567
Any long-term deal we
agree to must

963
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:20,133
be based on verifiable action
that convinces

964
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:23,533
us and the international
community that Iran

965
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:26,867
is not building a nuclear bomb.

966
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:28,100
If John F. Kennedy and

967
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,667
Ronald Reagan
could negotiate

968
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:33,100
with the Soviet Union, then
surely a strong and confident

969
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,767
America can negotiate with

970
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,567
less powerful adversaries today.

971
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:47,934
[Applause]

972
00:54:47,934 --> 00:54:50,166
The sanctions that we put
in place helped make

973
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:53,200
this opportunity possible.

974
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,500
But let me be clear: I
this Congress sends

975
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,800
me a new sanctions bill now
that threatens

976
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,867
to derail these talks, I
will veto it.

977
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:06,033
[Applause]

978
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:08,800
For the sake of
our national security,

979
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,400
we must give diplomacy
a chance to succeed.

980
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,967
[Applause]

981
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,600
If Iran's
leaders do not seize this

982
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,967
opportunity, then I will
be the first to call

983
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:25,667
for more sanctions, and stand
ready to exercise

984
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:28,300
all options to make sure Iran
does not build

985
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,100
a nuclear weapon.

986
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,867
But if Iran's leaders do
seize the chance --

987
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:37,900
and we'll know soon enough --
then Iran could

988
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,567
take an important step to rejoin
the community of nations,

989
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,700
and we will have resolved
one of the leading

990
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,233
security challenges of our
time without

991
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:48,233
the risks of war.

992
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,433
And, finally, let's
remember that

993
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,066
our leadership is defined
not just

994
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:58,800
by our defense against threats,

995
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,934
but by the enormous
opportunities to do good

996
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:05,367
and promote understanding
around the globe --

997
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,667
to forge greater cooperation,

998
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:14,033
to expand new markets, to free
people from fear and want.

999
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:15,834
And no one is better
positioned

1000
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:16,834
to take advantage

1001
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:18,367
of those opportunities than America.

1002
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:23,100
Our alliance with Europe
remains the strongest

1003
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,100
the world has ever known.

1004
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,834
From Tunisia to Burma,
we're supporting those

1005
00:56:28,834 --> 00:56:30,266
who are willing to do the
hard work

1006
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:32,266
of building democracy.

1007
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:36,333
In Ukraine, we stand for
the principle

1008
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:39,200
that all people have the right
to express themselves freely

1009
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,533
and peacefully, and
to have

1010
00:56:41,533 --> 00:56:43,533
a say in their country's future.

1011
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:47,133
Across Africa, we're
bringing together

1012
00:56:47,133 --> 00:56:49,700
businesses and governments
to double access

1013
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,300
to electricity and help
end extreme poverty.

1014
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,533
In the Americas, we're
building new ties

1015
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:58,633
of commerce, but we're also
expanding cultural

1016
00:56:58,633 --> 00:57:02,100
and educational exchanges
among young people.

1017
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,767
And we will continue to
focus on the Asia Pacific,

1018
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,934
where we support our
allies,

1019
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:11,667
shape a future of greater
security and prosperity,

1020
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:15,633
and extend a hand to those
devastated by disaster --

1021
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,100
as we did in the Philippines,
when our Marines and civilians

1022
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,500
rushed to aid those
battered by a typhoon,

1023
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,567
and who were greeted with
words like,

1024
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,500
"We will never forget your
kindness" and

1025
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
"God bless America."

1026
00:57:30,834 --> 00:57:33,867
We do these things because
they help promote

1027
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:38,333
our long-term security, and we
do them because we believe

1028
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:41,500
in the inherent dignity
and equality of every

1029
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,734
human being, regardless of
race or religion,

1030
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:47,500
creed or sexual orientation.

1031
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,100
And next week, the world
will see one expression

1032
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,066
of that commitment -- when
Team USA marches the red,

1033
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:55,800
white, and blue into
the Olympic Stadium,

1034
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,300
and brings home the gold.

1035
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,266
[Applause]

1036
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:07,233
Audience: USA!

1037
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,200
USA!

1038
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:17,266
USA!

1039
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:20,467
The President: My fellow
Americans, no other

1040
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:24,400
country in the world
does what we do.

1041
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,667
On every issue, the world
turns

1042
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:30,600
to us, not simply because of the
size of our economy

1043
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,266
or our military might, but
because of the ideals we stand

1044
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:41,166
for and the burdens we bear
to advance them.

1045
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,667
No one knows this better
than those

1046
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:43,633
who serve in uniform.

1047
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:48,734
As this time of war
draws to a close,

1048
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,734
a new generation of heroes
returns to civilian life.

1049
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:56,200
We'll keep slashing that
backlog

1050
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,400
so our veterans receive the
benefits they've earned,

1051
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,367
and our wounded warriors receive
the health care --

1052
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,300
including the mental
health care

1053
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,467
-- that they need.

1054
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:22,200
[Applause]

1055
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
We'll keep
working to help

1056
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,300
all our veterans translate their
skills

1057
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,333
and leadership into jobs here at home.

1058
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:31,266
And we will all continue
to join forces

1059
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:34,300
to honor and support our
remarkable military families.

1060
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,967
Let me tell you about one
of those families

1061
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:42,633
I've come to know.

1062
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:49,033
I first met Cory Remsburg,
a proud Army Ranger,

1063
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:54,367
at Omaha Beach on the 65th
anniversary of D-Day.

1064
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:56,000
Along with some of his
fellow Rangers,

1065
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,300
he walked me through the program
and the ceremony.

1066
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,033
He was a strong,
impressive young man,

1067
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:03,333
had an easy manner, he
was sharp as a tack.

1068
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,367
And we joked around and
took pictures,

1069
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:07,867
and I told him to stay in touch.

1070
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,900
A few months later, on his
tenth deployment,

1071
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,066
Cory was nearly killed by a
massive roadside

1072
01:00:18,066 --> 01:00:20,066
bomb in Afghanistan.

1073
01:00:21,633 --> 01:00:23,433
His comrades found him
in a canal,

1074
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:27,533
face down, underwater, shrapnel
in his brain.

1075
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,033
For months, he
lay in a coma.

1076
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:35,767
And the next time I met
him, in the hospital,

1077
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:39,667
he couldn't speak,
could barely move.

1078
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,533
Over the years, he's
endured dozens

1079
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:48,266
of surgeries and procedures,
hours

1080
01:00:48,266 --> 01:00:49,767
of grueling rehab every day.

1081
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,233
Even now, Cory is still
blind in one eye,

1082
01:00:55,233 --> 01:00:58,667
still struggles on
his left side.

1083
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:03,200
But slowly, steadily, with
the support of caregivers

1084
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,233
like his dad, Craig, and
the community around him,

1085
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:08,600
Cory has grown stronger.

1086
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,533
And, day by day, he's
learned to speak again

1087
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:16,100
and stand again
and walk again.

1088
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,266
And he's working toward
the day when

1089
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:21,266
he can serve his country again.

1090
01:01:24,066 --> 01:01:26,734
"My recovery has not
been easy," he says.

1091
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:32,467
"Nothing in life that's
worth anything is easy."

1092
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,667
Cory is here tonight.

1093
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,567
And like the Army he
loves, like the America

1094
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:45,233
he serves, Sergeant First
Class Cory Remsburg never

1095
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:46,767
gives up, and he
does not quit.

1096
01:01:46,767 --> 01:03:31,300
[Applause]

1097
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,200
My fellow Americans, men
and women like Cory

1098
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:39,133
remind us that America has
never come easy.

1099
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:44,066
Our freedom, our
democracy,

1100
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:46,066
has never been easy.

1101
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,433
Sometimes we stumble,
we make mistakes;

1102
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:53,433
we get frustrated or discouraged.

1103
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:59,033
But for more than 200
years, we have put those

1104
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:03,000
things aside and placed
our collective shoulder

1105
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,533
to the wheel of progress --
to create and build

1106
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:10,767
and expand the possibilities
of individual achievement;

1107
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:13,100
to free other nations
from tyranny and fear;

1108
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,633
to promote justice, and
fairness, and equality

1109
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:22,166
under the law so that the
words set to paper

1110
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:25,567
by our founders are made real
for every citizen.

1111
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,800
The America we want for
our kids --

1112
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,066
a rising America where honest
work is plentiful

1113
01:04:35,066 --> 01:04:39,200
and communities are strong;
where prosperity is widely

1114
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,166
shared and opportunity for
all lets

1115
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,367
us go as far as our dreams and
toil will take us --

1116
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:46,367
none of it is easy.

1117
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:53,367
But if we work together --
if we summon what

1118
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:56,500
is best in us, the way Cory
summoned what is best

1119
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,734
in him, with our feet planted
firmly in today

1120
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:02,100
but our eyes cast toward
tomorrow --

1121
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,333
I know it is within our reach.

1122
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:07,467
Believe it.

1123
01:05:08,633 --> 01:05:09,900
God bless you, and God
bless

1124
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,700
the United States of America.

1125
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:17,166
[Applause]
